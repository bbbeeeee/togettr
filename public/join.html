              When someone gets a new idea, they submit it and it rests in the idea incubator. Here, people can develop the idea and determine it's possibilities . When the idea gets sufficient builders and upvotes, the project gets transferred to the Fascinatory (fascinate factory). In the Fascinatory, the real building begins. Whenever a builder (i.e. you) has time, they can be a part of the project by helping with the tasks posted by other contributors who have joined the project. They can also submit new ideas, new tasks to do, and any other sort of contribution (i.e. new resources or information) to the project. This way, anyone who has anything to offer can contribute to the project to bring it closer to becoming a reality.

            <p id='intro'>When you're bored, what do you do? 
              Daydream. Imagine. 
              Many people get new ideas all the time, 
              but they just pass them off as dreams. 
              People should be able to open all of these ideas to the world. 
              While many may well be impossible, 
              many will be possible with the power of 
              crowd sourcing skills, knowledge, and resources. <br />
